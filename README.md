Learn Ruby the Hard Way
=======================

This repository contains the code I write as I work my way through Zed Shaw's ["Learn Ruby the Hard Way"](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/). The translation from [Python](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) to Ruby was done by [Rob Sobers](http://accidentalhacker.com/).

I'll go back to exercise 23 (where you find and read a bunch of Ruby code) when I know more Ruby.
