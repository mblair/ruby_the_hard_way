DESCRIPTIONS = {}

DESCRIPTIONS['central_corridor'] =<<HEREDOC
The Gothons of Planet Percal #25 have invaded your ship and destroyed
your entire crew. You are the last surviving member and your last
mission is to get the neutron destruct bomb from the Weapons Armory,
put it in the bridge, and blow the ship up after geting into an 
escape pod.

You're running down the central corridor to the Weapons Armory when
a Gothon jumps out, red scaly skin, dark grimy teeth, and evil clown costume
flowing around his hate filled body. He's blocking the door to the
Armory and about to pull a weapon to blast you.
HEREDOC

DESCRIPTIONS['laser_weapon_armory'] =<<HEREDOC
You do a dive roll into the Weapon Armory, crouch and scan the room
for more Gothons that might be hiding. It's dead quiet, too quiet.
You stand up and run to the far side of the room and find the
neutron bomb in its container. There's a keypad lock on the box
and you need the code to get the bomb out. If you get the code
wrong 10 times then the lock closes forever and you can't
get the bomb. The code is 3 digits.
HEREDOC

DESCRIPTIONS['the_bridge'] =<<HEREDOC  
You burst onto the Bridge with the netron destruct bomb
under your arm and surprise 5 Gothons who are trying to
take control of the ship. Each of them has an even uglier
clown costume than the last. They haven't pulled their
weapons out yet, as they see the active bomb under your
arm and don't want to set it off.
HEREDOC

DESCRIPTIONS['escape_pod'] =<<HEREDOC  
You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to
the escape pod before the whole ship explodes. It seems like
hardly any Gothons are on the ship, so your run is clear of
interference. You get to the chamber with the escape pods, and
now need to pick one to take. Some of them could be damaged
but you don't have time to look. There's 5 pods, which one
do you take?
